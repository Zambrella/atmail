## What is an atSign?

An atSign (e.g. @alice) is simply a resolvable address for an atServer. Anything can have an atSign, a person, entity, or thing (IoT), even individual songs or videos could have atSign addresses.

### What's it used for?

An atSign is used to protect and securely exchange information with other atSigns without any chance of surveillance, impersonation, or theft of the information by anyone.

### What characters can be used in an atSign?

An atSign supports any combination of Unicode UTF-8 characters that are translated to UTF-7 and must have less than characters 55 characters in length. This provides an enormous name space of 10^224 atSigns.

### How do I get an atSign?

Head to [the registrar site](https://my.atsign.com/go). It is recommended that you login with your email. One email can hold up to 10 free atSigns and unlimited paid atSigns.

### How do I generate my associated cryptographic keys?

There are multiple ways to generate the associated `.atKeys` file for an atSign. Within applications the .atKeys are stored in encrypted keychains that the OS provides.  Using the command line .atKeys files are produced and put in the directory `~/.atsign/keys`.

Most applications have a way to export the .atkeys to a file if you need to keep them safe or use them on another device.
