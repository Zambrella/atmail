# atRecord

atRecords are the data records that are stored by the atServers. We use the common key-value pair format.&#x20;

## atKey

An atKey is the identifier half of the "key-value" pair. Similar to the primary key of a tabular database, the atKey must be a unique string which represents the data.

There are 5 different types of an atKey.

<table><thead><tr><th width="119.33333333333331">Type</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Public</td><td>Store and share public data which can be seen by anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>Self</td><td>Store data which can only be seen by the owner.</td></tr><tr><td>Shared</td><td>Store and share private data which can only be seen by the owner and intended recipient.</td></tr><tr><td>Private</td><td>Store data which can only be seen by the owner, hidden by default.</td></tr><tr><td>Cached</td><td>Cache shared data from other atSigns for performance and offline mode.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Structure of an atKey

```
[cached:]<visibility scope>:<record ID><ownerâ€™s atSign>
```

#### Cached

A marker for whether it is a cached key or not.

#### Visibility Scope

A marker for who has access to the key.

#### Record ID

A unique string used to represent the atRecord.

#### Owner's atSign

The owner (i.e. creator's) atSign for that particular atRecord. The shared by atSign of an atRecord is synonymous to the owner atSign of an atRecord.

<summary>Rules for atKeys</summary>

1. Length of an atKey should not be more than 240 characters\
   (a limitation of the current implementation of the atServer, not a protocol limitation)
2. A maximum of 55 7-bit characters for the atSign (unicode is translated to UTF-7)
3. Allowed characters in an entity are: `[\w._,-"']`
4. Namespace is mandatory in the current implementation of the protocol\
   i.e entity must follow the notation: `<identifier>.<namespace>`
5. Cached atKeys should have a different owner than the current atSign
6. Visibility scope and owner cannot be the same for a shared atKey
7. Reserved atKeys cannot be [modified](../sdk/crud-operations.md) or [notified](../sdk/events.md)
8. For newly created atKeys, the owner must match the current atSign

<summary>Reserved atKeys</summary>

The following is a list of reserved atIKeys which the atServer requires to function.

**Don't** try to delete or overwrite these keys, the atServer cannot function without them.

* `privatekey:at_pkam_privatekey`
* `privatekey:at_pkam_publickey`
* `public:publickey`
* `privatekey:privatekey`
* `shared_key`
* `privatekey:self_encryption_key`
* `signing_privatekey`
* `public:signing_publickey`
* `privatekey:at_secret`
* `privatekey:at_secret_deleted`

<summary>Example atKeys</summary>

**Public atKey**

1. A `public` atKey with a record id of `location` shared by `@alice`. This atKey typically holds public data that any atSign can access.

`public:location@alice`

2. A `public` atKey with a record id of `publickey` shared by `@bob`. Note that this is a [reserved atKey](atrecord.md#reserved-atids).

`public:publickey@bob`

**Private atKey**

1. A `private` atKey with a record id of `pk1` shared by `@alice`.

`privatekey:pk1@alice`

**Shared atKey**

1. A `shared` atKey with a record id of `phone` shared with `@bob`, shared by `@alice`.

`@bob:phone@alice`

2. A `shared` atKey with the record id of `name`, a namespace of `wavi`, shared with `@alice`, and shared by `@bob`.

`@alice:name.wavi@bob`

**Internal atKey**

1. An `internal` atKey with a record id of `_latestnotificationid`, namespace of `at_skeleton_app` and is shared by `@alice`.

`_latestnotificationid.at_skeleton_app@alice`

**Cached atKey**

1. A `cached` atKey with a record id of `phone`, shared with `@bob`, and is shared with `@alice`.

`cached:@bob:phone@alice`

## atMetadata

Metadata of the atRecord is also stored and describes the following properties of the atValue.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="174.33333333333331"></th><th width="144"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Meta Attribute</strong></td><td><strong>Auto create?</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>availableFrom</td><td>Yes</td><td>A Date and Time derived from the ttb (now + ttb). A Key should be only available after availableFrom.</td></tr><tr><td>ccd</td><td>No</td><td>Indicates if a cached key needs to be deleted when the atSign user who has originally shared it deletes it.</td></tr><tr><td>createdBy</td><td>Yes</td><td>atSign that has created the key</td></tr><tr><td>createdOn</td><td>Yes</td><td>Date and time when the key has been created.</td></tr><tr><td>expiresOn</td><td>Yes</td><td>A Date and Time derived from the ttl (now + ttl). A Key should be auto deleted once it expires.</td></tr><tr><td>isBinary</td><td>No</td><td>True if the value is a binary value.</td></tr><tr><td>isCached</td><td>No</td><td>True if the key is cached.</td></tr><tr><td>isEncrypted</td><td>No</td><td>True if the value is encrypted.</td></tr><tr><td>refreshAt</td><td>No</td><td>A Date and Time derived from the ttr. The time at which the key gets refreshed.</td></tr><tr><td>sharedWith</td><td>No</td><td>atSign of the user with whom the key has been shared. Can be null if not shared with anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>updatedOn</td><td>Yes</td><td>Date and time when the key has been last updated.</td></tr><tr><td>ttb</td><td>No</td><td>Time to birth in milliseconds.</td></tr><tr><td>ttl</td><td>No</td><td>Time to live in milliseconds.</td></tr><tr><td>ttr</td><td>No</td><td>Time in milliseconds after which the cached key needs to be refreshed. A ttr of -1 indicates that the key can be cached forever. ttr of 0 indicates do not refresh. ttr of > 0 will refresh the key. ttr of null indicates the key is impossible to cache, hence, refreshing does not make sense (which has the same effect as a ttr of 0).</td></tr></tbody></table>

## atValue

Text or binary values can be saved in an atServer.&#x20;

**Small objects are fine to use the atServer but large objects should be used by reference.**

For example, derive a new encryption key, encypt a file, upload that file to location, then notify other atSigns of the location and the encyption key. This is how [atmospherePro](https://atsign.com/apps/atmospherepro/) works.

> **Warning**
> The size of the value saved in an atServer is bound by the atProtocol's config parameter "maxBufferSize".
